# To Do

- Walk through the TODOs in the code.
- Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`
- Check documentation.
- Containerize `tcsc`.
- Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).
- Add auto-skip of checks if the supportfiles do not provide the required data.


- The docker compose file needs to be extended to label all created resources (like volumes).
  This shall allow it easily to remove remnants by using the label.
