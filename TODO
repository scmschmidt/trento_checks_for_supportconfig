# ToDo

- Check if all created docker resources really get removed.
- Add tscs_cmd and host containers to the "stack".
- Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`

- Why are saptune checks unknown?
- Where are the ascsers_cluster checks?
- Provide images for the host and `tcsc` via GitHub.
- Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).
- Think about filter for listing checks to get a better overview. 
- Auto-skip of checks if the supportfiles do not provide the required data.
- Autodetection of provider (and other environments) should be implemented.
- Parallelize check executions to be faster.
- The docker compose file needs to be extended to label all created resources (like volumes).
  This shall allow it easily to remove remnants by using the label.
