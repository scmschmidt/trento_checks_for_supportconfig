# To Do

- Walk through the TODOs in the code.
- Check documentation.

- Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`


- Containerize `tcsc`.
- Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).

- The docker compose file needs to be extended to label all created resources (like volumes).
  This shall allow it easily to remove remnants by using the label.
