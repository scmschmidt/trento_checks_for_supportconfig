# To Do

- Why are saptune checks unknown?
- Where are the ascsers_cluster checks?

- Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`


- Containerize `tcsc`.
- Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).

- The docker compose file needs to be extended to label all created resources (like volumes).
  This shall allow it easily to remove remnants by using the label.
