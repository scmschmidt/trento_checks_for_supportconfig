# ToDo

- Very Soon:
  - Try to get the latest Wanda containers running (changed registry and checks have been removed).
  - Provide images for the host and `tcsc` via GitHub.
  - Select simple and multi checks per option (for people who want to group non-related supportconfig in one host group).
  - Checkout supportfiles for being candidates.
  - Check if all created docker resources really get removed.
  - Add tscs_cmd and host containers to the "stack".
  - Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`

- Later:
  - Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).

- Much Later:
  - Auto-skip of checks if the supportfiles do not provide the required data.
  - Auto-detection of provider (and other environments) should be implemented.
  - Think about filter for listing checks to get a better overview. 
  - The docker compose file needs to be extended to label all created resources (like volumes).
    This shall allow it easily to remove remnants by using the label.
  - Parallelize check executions to be faster.
