# ToDo

- Very Soon:
  - Add to README that the changes in this branch make the solution compatible only 
    with the Wanda version that has check separation.
  - Add check coverage section to the README (including version of support files).
  - Add tscs_cmd and host containers to the "stack".
  - Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`
  - Provide images for the host and `tcsc` via GitHub.
  - Rework install/uninstall by splitting it in separate steps.
    - Allows host and cmd image build as well as download from GHCR.
    - Support switching between rolling and released version in Dockerfile.
    - Support local directory as volume instead of check container to allow `tcsc` to be used for check development.
  - Check if all created docker resources really get removed.
  - Checkout supportfiles for being candidates.
    - `disp+work` \
      `plugin-ha_sap.txt` contains `/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/saphostexec -version |tail -30`, which might 
       be used as substitute for `disp+work` output, but better add `su - SIDAM disp+work` to the plugin.
    - `sap_profiles` \
       Can `sap_profiles` gatherer be put to work? `plugin-ha_sap.txt` contains profiles.
    - Check out `sapinstance_hostname_resolver`.
      `plugin-ha_sap.txt` might contain data. 
    - Checkout `ascsers_cluster` gatherer. 

- Later:
  - Select simple and multi checks per option (for people who want to group non-related supportconfig in one host group).
  - Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).
  - Try to get into the supportconfig:
      - some `saptune` output in JSON
      - output of `corosync-cmapctl -b`
      - content of files below `/etc/products.d/`

- Much Later:
  - Auto-skip of checks if the supportfiles do not provide the required data.
  - Auto-detection of provider (and other environments) should be implemented.
  - Think about filter for listing checks to get a better overview. 
  - The docker compose file needs to be extended to label all created resources (like volumes).
    This shall allow it easily to remove remnants by using the label.
  - Parallelize check executions to be faster.
