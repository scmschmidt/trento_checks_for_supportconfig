# ToDo
    
- Update README
  - adding -e should be described in the main text until we have autodetection
  - not all providers get detectd automatically!
  - Add section to list which files of the supportconfig are used for what
- Checks shall fail with `error` if the supportfiles do not provide the required data (manifest).
- Document manifest.
- Try to get into the supportconfig:
  - output of `corosync-cmapctl -b` for `corosync-cmapctl` gatherer
  - output of `su - SAPUSER -c disp+work` for `disp+work` gatherer
  - content of files below `/etc/products.d/` for `products` gatherer
  - output of `/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/saphostctrl -function Ping` for `saphostctrl` gatherer
- Implement `ascsers_cluster` gatherer to get a much better coverage.
- Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`
- Provide check development supportconfigs for (various) clusters.
- Finish Trento check development document (`Trento Check Development.md`).
- Auto-detection of `architecture_type` `ensa_version` and `filesystem_type` from supportconfig.
- Checkout other supportfiles to be added.
- Think about filter for listing checks to get a better overview. 
- Parallelize check executions to be faster.
