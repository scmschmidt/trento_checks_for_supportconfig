# ToDo

- Very Soon:
  - `process_supportfiles`:
    - implement and test saptune 
    - test missing files and commands having missing files 
  -Add to `checks run`:
    - a manifest integration (gatherer level? check level (dir)?)
  - Checkout supportfiles for being candidates.
    - `disp+work` \
      `plugin-ha_sap.txt` contains `/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/saphostexec -version |tail -30`, which might 
       be used as substitute for `disp+work` output, but better add `su - SIDAM disp+work` to the plugin.
    - `sap_profiles` \
       Can `sap_profiles` gatherer be put to work? `plugin-ha_sap.txt` contains profiles.
    - Check out `sapinstance_hostname_resolver`.
      `plugin-ha_sap.txt` might contain data. 
    - Checkout `ascsers_cluster` gatherer. 
    - Try to get into the supportconfig:
      - output of `corosync-cmapctl -b`
      - content of files below `/etc/products.d/`

  - Implement new checks (requires new environments besides provider).  

  - Auto-skip of checks if the supportfiles do not provide the required data (manifest).
  - Document manifest.
  - Add check coverage section to the README (including version of support files).

  - Add https://github.com/scmschmidt/rabbiteer as source for `rabbiteer.py`

- Later:
  - Provide check development supportconfigs for a cluster.
  - Finish Trento check development document.

- Much Later:
  - Auto-detection of other Trento environments as provider should be implemented and attached to host infos to be used in checks.
  - Think about filter for listing checks to get a better overview. 
  - Parallelize check executions to be faster.
